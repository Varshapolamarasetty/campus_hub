# campus_hub
Campus Hub is a college resource-sharing platform where admins (faculty/staff) can upload academic resources (notes, PPTs, PDFs, etc.), and students can log in to view and download them.  The project was built as part of an academic learning exercise to understand full-stack web development using Java, Servlets, MySQL, HTML,CSS and React.
